# Changelog

## 4.0.3 - 4/6/2021

### Fixed

- Fixed a `403 Client Error` that could randomly occur when bulk downloading a large number of filings. This error was most likely caused by recent changes to SEC rate-limiting behavior. It has been fixed by including a random user-agent string, generated by the [Faker package](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/providers/faker.providers.user_agent.html), in the request headers.

## 4.0.2 - 2/18/2021

### Fixed

- Fixed a `RecursionError` that could occur when downloading older filings with the `download_details` flag set to true. Thanks to @neilbartlett for reporting and fixing this bug!

## 4.0.1 - 1/23/2021

### Fixed

- Downloads will no longer halt prematurely if a filing document (full or detail) cannot be found (e.g. when the EDGAR Search API outputs incorrect download URLs). Now, the package will automatically catch such network errors, print a helpful warning message, and then proceed to download the remaining filings.

## 4.0.0 - 1/17/2021

This is a major breaking release. Please see the [v4 migration guide](https://github.com/jadchaar/sec-edgar-downloader/blob/master/docs/v4_migration_guide.md) for information on how to upgrade and adapt your existing codebase to the new package version.

### Added

- The [SEC Edgar Full-Text Search API](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/) is now used to fetch filing download URLs. This approach replaces the existing fragile scraping and ATOM RSS implementation used in existing versions of this package.
  - Note: this API only allows for fetching filings after December 1, 2000.
- Added support for searching and downloading filings via a `query` kwarg:
```python
dl = Downloader()
# Download all Apple proxy statements that contain the word "antitrust"
dl.get("DEF 14A", "AAPL", query="antitrust")
```
- Filing details, whose extensions vary based on filing type, are now downloaded in addition to the full submission `txt` file. See the migration guide for information on the revamped folder structure.
- Added the ability to download all available SEC filings. Please see the [README](https://github.com/jadchaar/sec-edgar-downloader/blob/master/README.rst) for a full list of all supported filings.
- `Path` objects can now be used to specify a `download_folder` when constructing a `Downloader` object.
- Added type annotations throughout the codebase.

### Changed

- The current working directory is now used as the default download location. Custom paths can be specified when constructing `Downloader` objects.
- All arguments passed to `dl.get()` other than `filing` and `ticker_or_cik` must be used with a keyword:
```python
dl = Downloader()
dl.get(
    "10-K",
    "AAPL",
    # All other arguments must be used with a keyword
    amount=1,
    after="2019-01-01",
    before="2021-01-01",
    include_amends=True,
    download_details=True,
    query="sample query"
)
```
- The `after_date`, `before_date`, and `num_filings_to_download` kwargs have been renamed to `after`, `before`, and `amount`, respectively.

## 3.0.5 - 5/16/2020

### Added

- Added support for DEF 14A filings (proxy statements).
- Added `tox.ini` and `Makefile` to distribution package.

### Fixed

- Fixed a failing test in the distributed package due to missing sample filings test data.

## 3.0.4 - 4/21/2020

### Added

- Added support for 20-F filings.

## 3.0.3 - 4/8/2020

### Added

- Added support for form 4 filings.

## 3.0.2 - 3/9/2020

### Added

- Added a 0.15s delay to download logic in order to prevent rate-limiting by SEC Edgar.

## 3.0.1 - 1/6/2020

### Added

- Added support for S-1 filings.

## 3.0.0 - 1/5/2020

### Added

- Added the ability to download more than 100 filings.
- Added the ability to specify an `after_date` argument to the `get` method. Example usage:

```python
from sec_edgar_downloader import Downloader
dl = Downloader()

# Get all 8-K filings for Apple after January 1, 2017 and before March 25, 2017
dl.get("8-K", "AAPL", after_date="20170101", before_date="20170325")
```

- Added a `supported_filings` property to the `Downloader` class, which gets a list of all filings supported by the `sec_edgar_downloader` package. Example usage:

```python
from sec_edgar_downloader import Downloader
dl = Downloader()

dl.supported_filings
```

### Changed

- Package has been completely re-written from the ground up.
- The `Downloader` class now has a single `get` entry point method. This change was made to improve and ease maintainability. Here is the new stub for the `get` method:

```python
class Downloader:
    def get(
        self,
        filing_type,
        ticker_or_cik,
        num_filings_to_download=None,
        after_date=None,
        before_date=None,
        include_amends=False
    )
```

Example usage of the new method:

```python
from sec_edgar_downloader import Downloader
dl = Downloader()

# Get all 8-K filings for Apple
dl.get("8-K", "AAPL")
```

### Removed

- Replaced retrieval methods for each filing type with a single point of entry. The bulk method `get_all_available_filings` has also been removed, so any bulk actions need to be completed manually as follows:

```python
# Get the latest supported filings, if available, for Apple
for filing_type in dl.supported_filings:
    dl.get(filing_type, "AAPL", 1)

# Get the latest supported filings, if available, for a
# specified list of tickers and CIKs
symbols = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "0000102909", "V", "FB"]
for s in symbols:
    for filing_type in dl.supported_filings:
        dl.get(filing_type, s, 1)
```

## 2.2.1 - 9/18/2019

- Added support for [form 10KSB](https://www.vcexperts.com/definition/form-10-ksb).
- Added docs and tests to PyPI distribution package.
- Locked the `requests` dependency to `v2.22.0` or greater to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

## 2.2.0 - 6/28/2019

- `sec-edgar-downloader` is now fully documented ðŸŽ‰. You can view the latest documentation at [sec-edgar-downloader.readthedocs.io](https://sec-edgar-downloader.readthedocs.io).
- Changed file encoding for filing downloads from `utf-8` to `ascii`. This switch was made because SEC filings should be [submitted in ASCII format](https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/quick-reference/create-ascii-files.pdf).
- Locked the `lxml` dependency to `v4.3.4` or greater to fix Python 3.8 install issues.

## 2.1.0 - 6/8/2019

- Added `before_date` parameter to each filing download method. If this value is not specified, it will default to the current date.
- Added `include_amends` parameter to each filing download method. If this value is not specified, it will default to false.
- Added support for passing relative (e.g. `./`, `../`) and user (e.g. `~/`) download paths to the `Downloader` constructor
- An `IOError` is no longer thrown when an invalid download path is passed to the `Downloader` constructor. Instead,`sec_edgar_downloader` will create all the necessary directories in the path if they do not exist.
- Filing documents are no longer downloaded in streamed chunks.
- Downloads are now written to disk with UTF-8 encoding.
- Added `__version__` variable to package.
- Travis CI now uses tox to lint and run tests.
- Added `verbose` flag to `Downloader` constructor to enable information printing (e.g. how many filings are found and downloaded). `verbose` will default to false, meaning that no download information will be printed by default.

## 2.0.1 - 5/13/2019

- Cleaned up README
- Tweaked package naming in setup.py

## 2.0.0 - 5/13/2019

- The method for obtaining 13F filings has been split up into two methods: one for obtaining 13F-NT filings and another one for obtaining 13F-HR filings
  - You can read about the differences [here](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm)
- You can now specify the number of filings to download in the `get_all_available_filings` method
- Simplified API by combining ticker and CIK functionality into a single method for each filing type
  - Available methods: `get_8k_filings`, `get_10k_filings`, `get_10q_filings`, `get_13f_nt_filings`, `get_13f_hr_filings`, `get_sc_13g_filings`, `get_sd_filings`, `get_all_available_filings`
  - All these methods can be passed either a CIK or ticker string
- Removed ticker validation to facilitate this simplified API change

- Class methods now return the number of filings downloaded
- Added Python 3.8 support

## 1.2.0 - 2/14/2019
